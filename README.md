### Hi, there

This is a simple project where plays my random whims about Vue and the Web, and to learn about the Vue ecosystem.

Preview at https://vue.chilfish.vercel.app

Chill out and enjoy the ride :sunglasses:. I'm try to use effective and efficient tools to improve the DX & UX. If you have any suggestions, please let me know. :pray: 

- [x] Typescript + Vue3 + Vite4 + eslint
- [x] UnoCSS and its icons
- [x] vueuse for DX
- [x] auto import the components and methods
- [x] Pinia for state management
- [x] pnpm of course

Note that, `/todo` & `/auth` require a backend server to work. Look at [todo-ender] for more. (Maybe They need to be rewritten by Nuxt.js)
